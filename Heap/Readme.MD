# Heap/Priority_queue

### Why heap exist in the first place
- Basically we can do the same operation with sorting in O(nlogn) time.
- Using heap we can do the same thing with O(nlogk) time.

### Identification
- Top, closest, smallest, largest K elements
- KeyWord: K would be mentioned

### Technique
When largest use = Min_heap (delete unnessery smaller elements from queue.top())
When smallest use = Max_heap (delete unnessery larger elements from queue.top())

### Practice questions
- Kth largest element of an array
- Kth smallest element of an array 
- Kth closest elements of an given element from array
- Top frequent K elements of an array
- Sort a K-sorted array
